May I ask you to look into CVS HEAD (and/or the "stable" olsr_04 branch
- ATM there is not much functional difference - see also
http://olsr.funkfeuer.at/)?

I have already killed the MAX_IFS constant completely in the HEAD (and
branch) - mainly because there was no code actually checking against
that limit.

I will look ASAP at your patch.
Actually I have a local checked out CVS HEAD which adds lots of -W
options and cleaned up the warnings (and fixed a few glitches detected
in that process).
And that patches version runs on my node.

Speaking about releases: I don't know how and when Andreas released a
new version.

It makes probably more sense to integrate your (and Sven-Olas) patches
based on 0.4.10 and produce 0.4.11 before I commit my patched tree since
I'm also "fixing" the coding style (we have at least 3 more or less
different coding styles throughout the source - not counting plugins -
and fixing that makes reading the code at least for me easier).

Bernd,

my collection of patches against 
http://www.olsr.org/releases/0.4/olsrd-0.4.10.tar.bz2 is complete so far. As 
anncounced, I've put them here 
http://212.222.128.68/sven-ola/nylon/packages/olsrd/files/ (sequence here: 
http://212.222.128.68/sven-ola/nylon/packages/olsrd/olsrd_0.4.10.bb). While 
I do not really care for coding styles (if required, run your favorite code 
beautifier), I'am very interested in function. I've ignored any stuff in CVS 
since the status of the repo is unclear to me (does libnet work? what about 
the windows switch?). And yes - a merge or fork may be necessary soon.

I don't care[0] as long as it is consistent throughout the code since it
makes my life easier.

/me too of course.

Andreas told me that libnet itself has problems with IPv6. That was the
point where he stopped on the libnet "adventure".

Hmm, are there any serious issues (apart from the wrong version number
and my inability to compile there ATM) with the Windows port?

And I prefer "merge".  Thanks for the links of the patches - I will also
look into them ASAP.

	Bernd

[0]: Well, I actually care[1] but such discussions/decisions tend to get
        religious so I try to keep such changes small.
[1]: If you actually want to know: Like Linux kernel except one
        indention level is 4 characters and *always* use "{" ... "}" -
even
        if there is only one statement in between to minimize
        patches/cvs-commits and thus the risk for rejects/conflicts.

Subject: [olsr-dev] LQ-FishEye + LinkQualityDjikstraLimit
Message-ID: <4579AC68.5050105@gmx.net>

Hello -

I think it should be better communicated on the web page that olsrd only 
works reasonable if ETX/LQ *and*  LinkQualityFishEye is used. Without 
the LinkQualityFishEye-Mechanism and redundant TC-messages (they should 
be more frequent than Hello messages, I'd say two or three times)  olsrd 
creates nice routing tables as long as there is no payload. As soon as 
payload is introduced routes flap and routing loops occur. So it is no 
longer true that LinkQualityFishEye-Mechanism is a experimental feature 
- it was that important missing improvement that made olsr finally 
functional for the Freifunk networks. Since LinkQualityFishEye it is no 
problem anymore to perform a FTP download over a route of 8 hops here in 
Berlin...

I think the configuration-file with ETX/LQ *and*  LinkQualityFishEye in 
/files/ should become the default when performing a make install. 
LinkQualityFishEye is compatible with olsr-nodes that don't use the 
algorithm - but I would recommend to update all nodes in your 
mesh-networks as soon as possible to have the mesh work nicely. See the 
Readme about FishEye. When I was in Dharamsala/India it became obvious 
that the AirJaldi mesh suffered Routing Loops because they didn't know 
how to configure olsrd for stable and reliable routes. They were using 
it with LQ/ETX and  a sliding window size that was too small and didn't 
know about LinkQualityFishEye.

LinkQualityDjikstraLimit is important in large mesh-networks like Berlin 
on embedded systems - otherwise the CPUs will overheat. But the 
implementation in 0.4.10 is still buggy, I think.

I'd suggest is high time to release a new 'stable' release of olsrd - 
there are too many important bugs in 0.4.10 which have been fixed in 
CVS. Last important one was the limitation of 32 hops max. that causes 
olsrd to crash.

I wrote a short text called 'The olsr-story' for www.open-mesh.net - 
Thomas Lopatic read it and we both think it would be a interesting read 
for people interested in the background of the development at Freifunk. 
It will give people a good insight about our experiences and thoughts 
about olsr.

Some people subscribed to the olsr-mailinglists may also be interested 
in the development of the B.A.T.M.A.N routing-daemon that we started 
after olsr-0.4.10.

B.A.T.M.A.N-III-0.1 binaries and sources will be available from December 
13th at www.open-mesh.net. Let's see how it performs in real life :)

I'm still using olsrd-0.5 pre every day - but I'm looking forward to the 
experiences with B.A.T.M.A.N. Gateway switching is a constant annoyance 
in olsrd when using stateful protocols like IM, VOIP etc.

Hi,

Suppose I need to implement some functionality in a plugin that requires 
a thread (pthread, actually), and from that thread I need to access the 
olsr functions and data structures available for plugins.

Is there a locking mechanism to allow this?, or should I by all means 
resort to use the scheduler timeout/callback scheme?

Nacho.

Hi all,

Does anyone here know where I could find a technical report, or even a
scientific paper, about OLSR-ETX? I have already made a search on the net
(using keywords "expected transmission count") and all I could find were
papers and presentations about the solely ETX. I'd like to know how ETX is
integrated into original OLSR.
Also I'd like to know if anyone here knows an OLSR-ETX module for ns2
simulations, and where I could find it. All I could find was an OLSR module
that is RFC compliant, thus not being useful for my simulation purposes.

Thanks in advance,

Hi Holger,

First of all, I'm sorry for the incomplete message I've sent earlier.

As I were saying, the paper you've indicated me only discuss about the use
of ETX in DSDV and DSR algorithms, and I am really interested about the MPRs
issue. Is there any other technical document? My main goal is implementing
an OLSR-ETX module for ns2, as a last resource if I don't find any
implementations on the net.

Thanks.

Hello Weverton,

with the MPR issue I can't help you. But I would think there is nothing
tricky with that in OLSR, because all nodes have to measure the Link
Quality and send it in there Hello-messages.

I found a proposal for ETX, but nothing more.

Hi Weverton,

If I remember this correctly (it's been a while...), olsrd selects MPRs
such that all two-hop neighbours are reachable via the best possible path.

We take all links from us to all one-hop neighbours and all links from
those one-hop neighbours to all two-hop neighbours and then calculate
optimal (two-hop) paths from us to all two-hop neighbours. Then we
select those one-hop neighbours that are involved in at least one of
these optimal paths as an MPR.

The most obvious difference between our implementation of ETX and ETX as
described in the cited paper is that we do not send extra packets to
detect the quality of a link. Instead, we detect the packet loss among
OLSR packets (HELLO, TC, etc.) received from our neighbours.

I am writing a paper about it. We also have experimental results from a 
measurements campaign.
For ns-2, I'all plan to integrate the LQ extension, however not befor 
having integrated an enhanced physical module.

Using add_olsr_socket is a good idea. It would eliminate the need for a separate thread. However the select() function is called by
the OLSR deamon only every "Pollrate" seconds, which would make the packet forwarding rather slow.

I'm not sure what is the best way to solve the possible locking issue.

Have you tried to comment out the call to IsNullMacAddress so that BMF accepts the SLIP interface?

I see. I think this is a bad design, and imposes a lot of limitations on 
the usage of add_olsr_socket.

As far as I know, the OLSR daemon just needs to:

1- Execute some processes periodically (expiration of messages and such).

2- See if there is something to read from one of the sockets under its 
control.

As it is done now, (2) is in reality done by (1), which imposes the 
severe limitations stated above.

However, IT IS POSSIBLE and RELATIVELY EASY to do it the proper way, 
though I'm afraid it would take a rewrite of much code:

One cau specify a timeout in the select() call. USE IT. However, there 
is a catch: when there is data available on one of the sockets, the call 
will return, data will be processed, but we still have to wait the 
remaining period of time until the previously specified wakeup time.

The timeout parameter is passed to the select() call as a pointer, so it 
COULD return the remaining time there. In fact, IT DOES in linux, thus 
implementation of this scheme in linux is perfectly possible (I've done 
that before), but this is a particularity of linux. In fact, posix says 
the timeout return value of select() is undefined, so the problem would 
be the implementation on other operating systems.

IMHO, the locking problem must be addressed somehow and soon, because I 
think it hampers the development of olsr plugins, which seems to be one 
of its bests strenghts. As we have discusses before, there are two ways 
to do this:

1- Multi thread, and provide appropriate locking mechanisms.
2- Single thread (as it is now), but rewrite the scheduler main loop in 
the above described way.

The current single thread scheme is nice, because one does not have to 
deal with the usual locking headaches (deadlocks and such). However, 
IMHO it has a serious limitation: gives too much power to plugins. As it 
is actually sort of cooperative multitasking, any DOS attack to a plugin 
will bring the whole olsr daemon (and network) to its knees.

Any thoughs? (specially interested in yours, Andreas).

Nacho.

Ok, maybe then IPv6 is a solution for OLSR or B.A.T.M.A.N. as well, but it should be not a problem witht he normal existing IP adresses to get an auto-ip-signement, the chance, that one IP adress is done twice, should be rare and till now I thought it is depending on not having a developer interested in coding this.

Internet is essential for the laptops, and as in afika is no cable, we need a wireless mesh. we already mentioned Batman or meshnode.net, which is able to autosign iP adresses, but closed source.

As this is the main question, if meshing is working to provide internet acess in Afrika and if it is open source or not... my vision of the laptop is, that all should be open. I would drop the webcam and get 1000 MB flash hard disk, as well one USB stick-slot, but not an MMC/SD-Card-Reader. there are USB-MMC/SD adapters for one euro.. 
Furthermore electricity is a problem of course, but we need energy in each house and each school, so.. we should switch to an 600-750 MHZ AMD Processor. Then Firefox, Thunderbird, Songbird, Open Office and Cspace and Classic SF.net-Mediaplayer can be distributed on that machine.
It make no sense to have a laptop without OOO and Firefox.

Of course I understand, that the first generation is already done and produced, but better change this and get a workable PC .
Drop the cam, drop the coloured display, switch the wording from 100-Dollar-Laptop to an 100-Euro-Laptop (which is 20 % more money) and justify it with an engeneering or production center in europe.

I can buy here a loptop with 1700 MHZ with 40 GB  HD & wifi but without CD-Rom for 499 Euro!! This is fully equipped and if you replace windows, then you get the hardware for 299 Euro. So... it should not so difficult to reduce the costs more. Even if it is 150 Euro..  Firefox and OOO and CSpace and Thunderbird are all ready.. so .. dunno why so much software engineering has to be done.

The main difficult thing is the meshing firmware. Here we need more testing with marvells Closed source or Batman / OLSR or Meshnode..
So please keep the cooperation to them and send them each 3 laptops with marvell chip for testing BATAMAN please...

I think Atheros is working on such a thing? Why not giving more HD-Flash and more Ram ?

Furthermore, we need a distribution of this laptop over Amazon.com and UPS,
so everyone can buy it, we then need to add the overhead of handling pauschal to the price, just double it, but everyone must be ablet to buy is at one central online store, ebay or amazon.

thanks for further discussions, a) using main applications like firefox and OOO as well as having an open source meshing firmware with auto-ip-signment.

Ivan and list

we all want the best for the OLPC project. So we discuss things and do the best we can.
This includes as well citicism to the basic lines and not everyone needs to understand the difference between operations done in RAM or ROM or HD-Flash operations.

Besides the modification of the laptop equipment and the pricing,
the internet acess is the main point in areas, where there is no lan or wimax.

So the wireless mesh is the main issue. It would be nice, to have it 
- open source to guarantee free developement, 
- and it would be nice to have it self-organizing in assigning IP adresses, 
as access points, servers and IP-configuration needs hadware and personal resources and know-how as well, as then as well a philosophical question comes in the frame, because a new market of million users is prepared and we do not want them all at "Marvell-ISP-Acess".

So open hopping protocols and competition to marvell through atheros is as well a discussable thing.
Meshing for MANETS will develop in the next three years a lot, so we will see. Here we need a wider discussion, more projects, a comparision of what is possible and which experience we have in USA, or European Projects with Meshnode nets.

Back to the laptop equipment, which is indeed a question of education (and so adresses as well to the project managers). In my opinon we do not need a sub-standard for the requesting countries.
So it should be Open-Office-Word and not ABi-Word, which is no one using.
So we have a seperation between USA and Afrika, and then within Afrika we have a seperation of Laptop generation 1 and Laptop generation 2? Only because it was not discussed before and forseen, that the laptop software is sub-standard? Of course I see the rising price and that we do not want to have a broken laptop market for normal business machines as well.

This is why I suggested to have monochrome black white displays and for the pricing the wording has already changed from 100-Dollar-Laptop to childrens-Machine (as it costs already 150 Euro). So another overhead of 50 Euro for the option to run standard software instead of sub-standard software would be ok in my eyes.

Think from the investor side, in european countries no school ministry or government is offering *any* money to the childrens education with laptops. The parents have to buy them. And now a poor country like africa is forced to buy subs-standards (with money they do not have), as it is already clear today, that we will habe a second generation childrens machine? What about the return on invest? Be aware: *If* there is a second generation childrens machine, then the first generation is fully for the trashcan!

So it is not wrong to focus on quality management and to have a foucs on the invested money into the right equipment. My suggestion was to discuss the equipment of the software and then to define the needed hardware. There is even no wiki or bugs-thread or mailinglist definition-discussion done, which software is needed.

Example: Which Instant Messenger is used? Why an own protocol/client? why not the decentral serverless and enterprise-less linux messenger http://Cspace.in ? It would be perfect because it is open source, worldwide new and a serverless p2p communication, not related to any company. Why then a google talk´s jabber clone with teh efford to code it?

As said: I recommend as well Firefox Browser, Thunderbird Mailclient, Sonbirdnest.com Music Player, SF.Net-Classic Mediaplayer, and as well Open Office.org applications and sf.net-Monocalendar. xvid codec.

To run these, we need a linux operating system, hardware with one USB-Slot (not three), we do not need a webcam, microphone or a coloured display, so a black white monochrome display allows to have a better battery: lithium instead of nickel. And we need a 2 GB flash-HD and a 750 MH AMD processor.

I have an old PC with 500 MH and widows xp is very slow, so it has for linux to be at least 750 MHz roundabout, I guess, to play music with songbirdnest or mail with thunderbird.

I am aware, that all is always a compromise. So better a 180 Dollar Laptop with no substandard as a 100-150 Dollar Laptop with wrong equiped software. Whatfor do we have a open source development like Firefox and openoffice???? Not using this is as well a bashing of these projects.
 
so... 750 MHZ processor .... and Lithium battery... and 2 GB flash memory.
therefore no cam, no microphone and only a monochrome display.
And not a second generation laptop eliminating the mistakes of the first generation, deliver quality from the first laptop! Children in Europe would not buy a substandard.
That´s all I wanted to suggest to adjust or modify a little bit.

Kind Regards, happy christmas and hope, the next santa claus will bring these laptops!


PS: Don´t forget a 10 meters engergy cable. ;-) or: even better: a power solution over the usb/Ethernet-cable, which will be connected to the schools server.

Hi,

Although it's still an IETF draft -not an RFC-, OLSR version 2 is  
already submitted. Should it be considered to be included in olsrd?!  
It has some major improvements about the network-wide broadcast of  
link-state information and mantaining partial link-state information  
on each node.

I think you should have an eye on the draft:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-02.txt

What do you think about??



Zeus.

Without having read the draft, I belive OLSRv2 is still based on
the concept of MPRs. Real life experience has shown that this
concept is not a very successfully one. As olsrd has moved along
from a more or less theoretical test implementation to a real-life
experiment it has become something very different from RFC3626.

So even though OLSRv2 is definetly something to have an eye on,
I do not believe it will be implemented as part of olsrd. Read more
about the real-life experiments and the extensions needed for
olsrd to work properly in real-life meshes at:
https://www.open-mesh.net/optimized-link-state-routing-deamon/olsr-story.txt/view

My guess is that B.A.T.M.A.N. will have taken over for olsrd by
the time OLSRv2 reaches RFC :-)

Anyway, that is my $0.02...

I seem to remember having used this approach in olsrd earlier... Hmmm... 
might
just be that I've planned on doing it that way. Anyways, yes, I think 
using select
with a timeout instead of sleeping is a good idea. And as for the return 
value
of the timeval I guess the best thing would be just to grab a timestamp 
prior
to and after calling select(after if the FD set was set, and after the 
data was
processed which would not be taken into account if just using the returned
timeval) and keep on calling select until the scheduler should kick in.

I do not believe this is something for the next release which will 
mainly be a bugfix
release, but I agree it should be addressed pretty soon.

Hi all,

The last message sent in the list brought me some doubts about the technical
details of olsrd.

First: in http://www.olsr.org/docs/README-Link-Quality.html it is discussed
about the Link Quality Extension to OLSR and how it is implemented in olsrd.
But according to the text mentioned by Andreas in his last message (the one
posted by Elektra about the history of olsr), I believe the document that
talks about the link quality extension is a little outdated, because it
makes mention of MPR as being part of olsrd. Maybe the documentation has
wrong information about olsrd. My question is: was the MPR concept
completely banned from olsrd (I mean, when olsrd does not work just as
specified by RFC 3626)? Since which version of olsrd was the MPR concept
banned?

Second: making a search in the message archive of the OLSR.ORG mailing lists
I found the message at
http://www.olsr.org/pipermail/olsr-users/2004-November/000317.html that also
mentions about MPRs. That e-mail refers about the 0.4.8 version of olsrd,
which I believe is not too far from the current version. Where I could find
documentation that really describes the technical details of olsrd in a
broader view?

Third: how does olsrd calculate the link quality values and the ETX for a
given path? The e-mail I have mentioned earlier contradicts the Link Quality
documentation of olsrd. For example, while the e-mail says the ETX value for
a given path is the multiplication of the ETX value for every hop along the
path, the Link Quality extension document says the total ETX value for a
given path is the sum of the ETX calculated at every hop along the path.
Needless to say that ETX values for each hop in the path are calculated far
different.

Once and again talking about MPRs, what was the heuristic used to calculate
the MPR set in olsrd, when using the Link Quality extension? Have you seen
at IEEE digital library papers that discuss new methods of calculating the
MPR set? Some of them are quite interesting, I think, as they discuss ways
of making nodes with good conectivity or low delay to their neighbors being
selected as MPRs by the current node. The best proposal I have seen so far
as the QOLSR and QOLSR+. Do you have any words about it? Or could someone
even point me the thread in which this subject was previously discussed in
the list.

Thanks in advance,

Hi 

I have a question too,
- Is OLSR-2 the followup of OLSR or just a paraphrase of OLSR ? what are the differences between all three?
- I read about the new Ieee 802s or what it was called and it was stated, that a routning on a MAC-Level is better than a routing on a IP level. Why is OLSR then not switching?
- The "Auto-Discover-Feature" (flooding the network and knowing all IP/mac adresses) means as well to sign all IP adresses, why not or which of the three protocols is integrating this? As I read in the wikipedia, both draft standards for the 802.s for 2008 would contain this. As well the OLPC Meshing driver from marvell will include this.
- Marvell could be open source, just needs a porting: see the threadstart here: http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/devel/2006-December/003390.html

Wouldn´t it be cool, to have an open source meshing network on the www.laptop.org ?

I didn't read details (e.g. the standard) about it either but AFAIK:
- They (want to) support AODV (re-active) and OLSR (pro-active
  "routing") with - in my impression of what I heard/read - AODV has the
  higher priority (and I do absolutely not know where this comes from -
  can be well because of some person working on it and thus more
  progress/practical usability).
- Putting "OLSRD into the MAC layer" sounds great and simple. As with
  most great and simple ideas, things get more complicated if you look
  into details like
  * how similar is the 802.11s protocol messages and behaviour?
  * at least for Linux this implies making a kernel module out of the
    the user-space daemon. While this is not rocket science, is it a lot
    of work (e.g. has a kernel usually no C-library[0], very little
    space on the stack and to "sleep" cannot done with a simple function
    call. And the interface to the IP layer above and the core MAC layer
    is probably different to the current one).
  * Not all of the daemon makes sense in kernel space (e.g. most of the
    plugins). So if the goal is inclusion into the official Linux
    kernel (which IMHO must be a goal) implies an interface (e.g. a char
    driver at least) from the kernel part to the user-space, otherwise
    it will IMHO not be included.
  * The license of OLSRD is BSD. Putting parts into the kernel implies
    rewriting these since is needs GPL. Period.
  * Interfacing with different MAC layer implementations (Ethernet,
    Wireless, FDDI, ...) must be implemented and tested. I never dug
    into that part of kernel hacking yet so I don't know if and how this
    could be possible (not even in theory) - or even the needed effort.
    Do you know anyone who is willing to fund a journey on a road with
    unknown length?
  * Can 802.11s work with MAC addresses of different lengths (Ethernet
    and most others have 6 bytes, FDDI has 14 IIRC)?
  * And while I'm at it: What is with VLANs?
  * What to do if one detects duplicate MAC addresses?
    Yes, I know the theory about "no duplicate MAC addresses" but given
    the vast amount of of network cards of 3Com, RTL, etc. I doubt that
    the "Ostrich algorithm"[1] will be sufficient.
  * How large are the networks?
    If you get 1E6 nodes, your ARP table will have (at least!) 1E6
    lines (and the needed RAM for it). Have fun with that on small
    hardware.
  On the positive side:
  * One gets rid of a routing daemon on every node.

Don't get me wrong I sure it is absolutely possible and doable - it is
just a lot of work.
